# IDE Settings

In this short article I'll tell you how I customized my main code editor **Visual Studio Code**.

## Basics

I didn't change the font - I use the default one which is called **Consolas**. My font size is set to **18**. The main reason for that is livestreaming coding on Twitch.

## Theme

I have two favourite themes - [Ayu Mirage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu) and [Moonlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atomiks.moonlight). File and folder icons which represent the coding languages are from the [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).

## Extensions

If you want to save some time when creating new **React components or Next.js pages** you should definitely try out [ES7 React snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets). This extension supports **Typescript** and also various syntax options.

Code is formatted by [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and checked by [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

When I started coding I used normal CSS and later tried out Sass. Today I really use just **TailwindCSS**. That's why [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) comes in handy.

Here are some other useful extensions I've installed:

- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
- [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [PostCSS Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss)
- [Prisma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma)

I also have more extensions for intellisense and formatting of other individual languages and frameworks but you can find and install those according to your needs.

## Conclusion

So this is my IDE setup which I used to build a lot of websites and web applications **including this one**. I hope that this article helped you ;)
